    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>A little about me is that I am proficient in three languages: English, Gujarati, and Hindi. I was born on New Year's which is always pretty exciting.<br>
        I am here studying at UAB, and I actually do not own any pets, but I really do want to own a parrot someday. Besides that, I follow a pretty basic routine <br>
        of work, school, self-improvement methods such as learning, working out, or practicing useful skills such as writing.</p>
