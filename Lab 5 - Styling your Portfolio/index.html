    <p>I am multilingual, with proficiency in English, Gujarati, and Hindi. An interesting fact about me is that I was born on New Yearâ€™s Day,
    which always makes for a festive celebration. While I currently do not have any pets, I aspire to own a parrot in the future.
    My daily routine includes managing my business, engaging in academic studies, and committing to personal growth through continuous learning,
    physical fitness, and refining valuable skills like writing.</p>
